# Election-Analysis
Python &amp; VS Code

## Project Overview

### Purpose

Our team was tasked with creating an analysis of election data to present the results of an election for individual candidates as well as provide the result of the overall winner of the election.  The specific request for our team was from a Colorado Board of Elections employee and was to
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calcuate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based upon popular vote.

### Resources

Data source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code 1.58.2

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis of the election data show that:

1. There were 'x' votes cast in the election overall
2. The candidates were:
3. The candidate results were:
4. The winner of the election was:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Challenges were experienced in refactoring the VBA code to increase the efficiency and run time of this macro.  Nested indices and loops contributed to greater efficiencies but required increased programming time and labor.  However, the usability of this macro for future analyses of larger data sets justified this expenditure.   

Additionally, if the customer is interested in focusing on DAQO stock, a more granular and longitudinal analysis of the performance of this stock and the company based on products, goals, company values, and business plans is recommended as the fluctuation between positive and negative returns and volume for this stock are highly variable.  With inconsistent data as DAQO is presenting, it is difficult to make a confident recommendation for investment or non-investment.

## Results & Recommendations

In summary, the analysis of the clean energy stock data showed DAQO as a fluctuating stock with inconsistent volumes consistently below the average trading volume of clean energy stocks.  This stock represents a possible risk as a consistent pattern of behavior has not been found.  It is recommended that an increased analysis be conducted beyond two years of data to allow for a more longitudinal analysis of stock price and volume performances in the clean energy sector.  Also, considerations of technological and economic factors impacting price and volume fluctuations should be included to inform interpretations of sector wide return and volume fluctuations. 

The analysis of this data produces the following recommendations to our customer for investing in clean energy stock:  
*DAQO stock appears unstable and is trading at a lower than average volume.  A recommendation for investment in DAQO cannot be made at this time.  The customer is advised to invest in stocks that show more volume and more consistent positive return, such as demonstrated in the behavior of the ENPH stock over 2017 and 2018. Further analysis as recommended above is suggested if greater evidence is required for investment decisions.*
